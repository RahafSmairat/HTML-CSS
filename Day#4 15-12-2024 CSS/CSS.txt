** CSS is used to add style to the HTML webpage.

** There are 3 methods to add CSS to the webpage:

- Inline: Directly to the element tag.
- Internal (embedded): In the head section within <style> tag.
- External: Separate file with extension .css and link it using <link> tag within the head            
  section.

** How does CSS works:

1- When the browser loads the HTML, it convert it into DOM.
2- Linked recourses within HTML will be fetched (Videos, Images, CSS files, etc).
3- The browser will parse the CSS and based on the selector type it applies the style to the     
   correct node on DOM (Render Trees).
4- The visual website appears on the screen.

** CSS selectors: We use the selectors to target a specific HTML element to style it.

** Types of CSS selectors: 

- Universal (*): to select all elements.
- Type: targets an element.
- Class (.): targets a class with specific value.
- ID (#): targets an ID with specific value.

** Grouping Selectors: We can group selectors by separating them with commas to avoid repetition.
** Descendant Selectors: We use it to target nested elements.

** Pseudo-classes: Special state of an element (Hover, Visited/Unvisited, checked, etc).
** nth-child(An-B): selects a child based on it's position, n is all integers > 0.
   example: even items nth-child(2n) and odd is nth-child(2n+1).

** Text properties: 
   - color to change the font color by color name/ Hex value #000000 or RGB value rgb(0,0,0)
   - font-family: to change the font family.
   - font-size.
   - text align: left, right, center, justify (equal lines), initial (default), inherit  
(parent).

** Background properties:
   - background-color: color, transparent, initial or inherit.
   - background-image: url("")

** Box Model: 
  - Content: the text or image itself.
  - Padding: area around the content.
  - Border: around the padding.
  - Margin: area around the border.

** Units of Measurement:
   - Absolute (Fixed length): px, cm, mm
   - Relative (Based on another length property): em (font-size), rem (root size), % (parent element), vh (1% of veiwport hight), vw (1% of veiwport width).
