1- Can we add a form inside another? Why or why not?

   No we cannot do so, because nested forms are not allowed in HTML as only one form can be active per page.
   There can be a confusion when submitting forms and some actions might be ignored.

2- What would happen if we have more than one submission input?
   We can have more than one, but only one (the clicked one) will be sent along with the data. 
   And we can handle multiple buttons based on the button name or value.

3- How to submit a form without the submit button?
   By clicking "Enter" key, using JS or using a link and trigger submission with JS.
